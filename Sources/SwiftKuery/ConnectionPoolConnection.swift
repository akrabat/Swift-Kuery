// MARK: ConnectionPoolConnection

/**
 This class uses a `Connection` instance and a `ConnectionPool` instance to implements a wrapper for the `Connection` class.
 It implements the functions of the `Connection` protocol, in addition to the `closeConnection()` function
 for releasing a `Connection` instance from the `ConnectionPool`.
 It is usually initialised by the `ConnectionPool` instance.
 ### Usage Example: ###
 In this example, a `ConnectionPool` instance is initialized (parameters defined in docs for `ConnectionPool`).
 A `ConnectionPoolConnection` instance called "connection" is then returned by calling "getConnection()" on "connectionPool".
 The closeConnection() function is then called on connection to release it from the pool.
 ```swift
 let connectionPool = ConnectionPool(options: options, connectionGenerator: connectionGenerator, connectionReleaser: connectionReleaser)
 let connection = connectionPool.getConnection()
 connection.closeConnection()
 ```
