// MARK: Migration

/**
 A class to help with migrations between two versions of a table.
 
 ### Usage Example: ###
 The suggested usage is to keep versions of the table classes somewhere in the application code:
 ```swift
 public class MyTable_v0: Table {
     let a = Column("a", ...)
     let b = Column("b", ...)
     let tableName = "MyTable"
 }
 public class MyTable_v1: Table {
     let b = Column("b", ...)
     let c = Column("c", ...)
     let tableName = "MyTable"
 }
 ```
 And use a typealias to refer to the current version of the table class in the application:
 ```swift
 typealias MyTable = MyTable_v0
 let t = MyTable()
 let q = Select(from t)
 ...
 ```
 The migration code from v0 to v1 should be something like this:
 ```swift
 let t0 = MyTable_v0()
 let t1 = MyTable_v1()
 let migration0 = Migration(from: t0, to: t1, using: connection)
 migration0.alterTableAdd(column: t1.c) { result in ... }
 ```
 And raw alternations, if needed:
 ```swift
 let dropColumnQuery = "ALTER TABLE " + t1.tableName + " DROP COLUMN " + t0.a.name
 connection.execute(dropColumnQuery) { result in ... }
 ```

public class Migration {
    
    private let connection: Connection
    private let table1: Table
    private let table2: Table
    private var renamed = false
    
    // MARK: Initializer
    /**
     Initialize an instance of `Migration` with the tables you are migrating between
     and the connection to the database, where the tables are located.
     ### Usage Example: ###
     
     ```swift
     let connection = getConnection()
     let oldTable = MyTable_v0()
     let newTable = MyTable_v1()
     let migration = Migration(from: oldTable, to: newTable, using: connection)
     ```
     */
    /// - Parameter from: The version of the table to migrate from.
    /// - Parameter to: The version of the table to migrate to.
    /// - Parameter using conenction: The connection to the database to use.
    public init(from: Table, to: Table, using connection: Connection) {
        self.connection = connection
        table1 = from
        table2 = to
    }
    // MARK: Table Alteration

    /**
     Builds an executes an SQL query to alter the name of the old table to the name in the new version of the table.
     ### Usage Example: ###
     In this example, a `Migration` instance is initialized.
     The alterTableName function is called to initiate the SQL query, which changes the name.
     The "alterHandler" is a closure which handles the response from the database.
     ```swift
     let migration = Migration(from: oldTable, to: newTable, using: connection)
     migration.alterTableName(alterHandler)
     ```
     */
    /// - Parameter onCompletion: The function to be called when the execution of the query has completed.
    public func alterTableName(onCompletion: @escaping ((QueryResult) -> ())) {
        let query = "ALTER TABLE " + Utils.packName(table1._name, queryBuilder: connection.queryBuilder) + " RENAME TO " + Utils.packName(table2._name, queryBuilder: connection.queryBuilder)
        renamed = true
        connection.execute(query, onCompletion: onCompletion)
    }

    /**
     Create and execute an SQL query to add a `Column` to the new table in the `Migration` instance.
     ### Usage Example: ###
     In this example, `Migration` and `Column` instances are initialized.
     The `alterTableAdd` function is called to add the `Column` instance to the "newTable" within the `Migration` instance.
     The "alterHandler" is a closure which handles the response from the database.
     ```swift
     let migration = Migration(from: oldTable, to: newTable, using: connection)
     let toDo_title = Column("toDo_title", String.self, notNull: true)
     migration.alterTableAdd(column: toDo_title, onCompletion: alterHandler)
     ```
     */
    /// - Parameter column: The column to add. This should be a column in the new version of the table.
    /// - Parameter onCompletion: The function to be called when the execution of the query has completed.
    public func alterTableAdd(column: Column, onCompletion: @escaping ((QueryResult) -> ())) {
        let tableName = renamed ? table2._name : table1._name
        do {
            let query = try "ALTER TABLE " + Utils.packName(tableName, queryBuilder: connection.queryBuilder) + " ADD COLUMN " + column.create(queryBuilder: connection.queryBuilder)
            connection.execute(query, onCompletion: onCompletion)
        }
        catch {
            onCompletion(.error(QueryError.syntaxError("Failed to alter table: \(error)")))
        }
    }
}
